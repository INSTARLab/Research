Welcome! This guide uses simple space examples to help you understand the different tools and ideas data scientists, computer scientists, and AI experts use. This can help you see what skills a candidate might bring to our team.

**What are we looking at?**

**Data Structures:** Think of these as different ways to organize and store information, like different types of containers for stars and planets.

**Methods & Models:** These are ways to _use_ the stored information to find patterns, make predictions, or understand relationships – like using star charts to predict an eclipse.

**Understanding the "Expertise Level" (⭐):**

⭐ **Basic:** Every tech person should know this.

⭐⭐ **Foundational:** Core concepts for anyone working with data.

⭐⭐⭐ **Intermediate:** Shows a good working knowledge of common data science tools. Candidates discussing Bayesian methods comfortably are often at this level or above.

⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Advanced:** Indicates deeper understanding and ability to work with more complex data and models. If a candidate talks about using Tensors or creating Embeddings, they're likely at this level.

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ **Expert / Cutting-Edge:** Familiarity with these concepts (especially implementing them) suggests a high level of expertise, often found in specialized AI roles.

**Why this matters for HR:**

**Identifying Growth Areas:** If a candidate confidently discusses Tensors, Embeddings, or various Neural Networks, they are likely working with more modern and often more powerful techniques for complex problems.

**Role Fit:** An AI Research Scientist might be expected to know about GNNs or even QNNs (conceptually for QNNs, as practical application is still emerging). A Data Analyst might be excellent with everything up to ⭐⭐⭐. A Data Scientist building predictive models would ideally be comfortable up to ⭐⭐⭐⭐ or even ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐.

This guide should help your team ask better questions and understand where a candidate's knowledge fits in the broader landscape of data science!
