Product Requirement Documentation
1. Product Overview
The product is an intelligent documentation application designed to automate the grant writing process. It leverages the capabilities of the LISA App and logic apps to facilitate the process. The application will be used across multiple departments that require extensive documentation, including grant creation, business plan creation, and visa applications for USIVA.
2. User Interaction
Users will interact with the application through Adaptive Cards, answering O.R.B.I.T.A.L. questions (Objective, Resources, Budget, Indicator, Transport, Activity, Logistics). The application will also ask users where they save their files (e.g., SharePoint) and where they save their final Word file, which can be a blank file.
3. Data Management
User responses will be directed to a master Excel sheet, which will contain all the sheets for the business plan, visas, ORBITAL for grant, etc. This master sheet will serve as the primary data source for the application.
4. Content Generation
The application will leverage AI to intelligently generate content based on the data in the master Excel sheet. The generated content will be transferred to the appropriate Word Template (Business Plan Template, E-2 Template, Grant Template).
5. Integration
The application will be integrated with existing systems such as Dream Hub and SharePoint for seamless data management and content generation.
This is a high-level overview of the product requirements. We can delve into more specific requirements as we progress with the project.
