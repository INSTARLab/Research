From our meeting with @haiderrizvi92, we discussed how to get ANDROID OPS get funded,

1. Make a proposal letter that includes an overview of our project. (2 weeks)
- Outline of "ANDROID OPS"
- How it will impact society
- What is lacking in current methods that ANDROID OPS will address

2. Find the right POC in [NSF.gov](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities)https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities
- Research the right funding department
- Research the right POC for this department
